# Masterthesis - Interactive Program to Generate Ornamental Pictures
The program allows the user to create ornamental pictures by adding Euclidean transformations to the drawing plane step by step.
Euclidean transformations are translation, reflection, rotation and glide reflection. 
In particular, the user can generate the 17 crystallographic groups aka wallpaper groups.

The interface of the program consists of a drawing plane and a control panel.
In the control panel the user can select the drawing color, pen size and transformation type.
